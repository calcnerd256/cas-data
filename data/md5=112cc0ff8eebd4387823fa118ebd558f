I took a suggestion to split this into files and metadata.

previous.txt describes the last e-mail I sent out.
draft.txt is about how much to send this time.  When it says "this one" and "here", it's talking not about itself as a document but about this issue of the newsletter, because I originally wrote it inline inside this document and then moved it into its own file.
proxy_implementation.txt starts out talking about source code files I am going to publish for my reverse proxy, and then it moves on to talk about a possible future way to edit such source code.
mailing_list.txt talks about the future direction of this mailing list.
errata.txt mentions some mistakes I've made in previous files I've published.

A new week, a new digest.
