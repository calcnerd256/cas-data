Right after sending out that last e-mail, I noticed a typo in the first sentence of it.
I said "keep doing adding" where I should have said "keep adding".
Then, as I was filing the contents of the e-mail into my TSV for this month, I noticed that I had put the wrong prefix on the mailing list name.
I said "[sigcf.firehose]" instead of "[msr.firehose]".
It's sort of true, but it's not what I've been calling it.
So, that's annoying.
Sorry about that.
