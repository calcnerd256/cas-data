		<h2><i>provenance</i></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The original text
				of the rough draft
				of this document
				had an MD5 of
				<a href="./md5=7e9d2f6a061b7ad330e1f0173bf69a72">7e9d2f6a061b7ad330e1f0173bf69a72</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The HTML version
				of the rough draft
				has an MD5 of
				<a href="./md5=4eaa2d17b974764f2dfa6ab63cf58b2b">4eaa2d17b974764f2dfa6ab63cf58b2b</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The first paragraph
				of that
				has an MD5 of
				<a href="./md5=96cc20c6e5def0f9c6bd05656b239813">96cc20c6e5def0f9c6bd05656b239813</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				My first attempt to revise the rough draft was <a href="./md5=7203d7bf2be27ddb273e87a5c0e95ed2">to extract assertions from it</a>, or "facts" as I was calling them.
				When that didn't work, I <a href="./md5=dedb14ceb8065a4d010d2dae7b4c2626">tried to label all the nouns</a>.
				Then I tried <a href="./md5=097eef3fe78229fc09c28cd158d91872#structure">some other approaches</a>, which didn't make it past the first sentence.
				I did all of this inside of this document, and then I collected snapshots of each of these approaches into their own documents and linked to them here as historical documents.
				That way, I could start over here without losing those failed attempts.
				You are not expected to read them, but you may if you wish.
			</li>
			<li>
				I wrote
				<a href="./md5=582e56dab955c577637cf3bc0bb9e4af">a second draft</a>,
				but it still wasn't good enough.
			</li>
			<li>
				I realized that the second draft was actually two stories.
				So I extracted <a href="./md5=4f597aa25b3399440b76ef606de22fdb">the story of my fake Lisp</a> from it.
				What remained was <a href="./md5=aac1ecd2550bfc4acabecfddb22abf3d">publishing a file to copy it</a>.
