Comma-separated values are a kind of spreadsheet file format.
They are human-readable, hand-editable text files.
They have a "," character between the cells in a row, and they have one row per line.
I think they start with a line that has the format of a row and contains in its cells the names of the columns.
Maybe they don't have to have that.
They are described in the IETF's RFC (Request for Comments) number 4180.
You can use other delimiters instead of the comma character.
I like to use the tab character, because it is unlikely to occur in my data.
https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values seems to say that I can use a MIME type of text/tab-separated-values for those.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/264256/what-is-the-best-mime-type-and-extension-to-use-when-exporting-tab-delimited#comment100993466_316623 mentions the header=present component, which I would want to use for mine.

When I was trying to make some sense of my weekly index files, I tried turning them into tab-separated values files so that I could more easily work with them.
I plan to publish those after the month rolls over.
I can't publish them sooner, unless I'm willing to publish partials, which I'm not.
I can, however, publish some of them: the ones that aren't going to change.
I have one that associates each calendar day with its time interval in my time zone, for the month of December this year.
That one isn't going to change, because that relationship isn't going to change.
Its MD5 is 58bb96400d875129a0e83148134fcbd2.

Another TSV file that isn't going to change is the mapping from the first few weeks' e-mails to the topics they touched on.
I stopped tagging e-mails with topics in the index (or "digest" as it was called then) because it was too much work and not worth much.
Still, since those were in the first few weeks of index files, I wanted to include them in the TSV version of the month's index, so those are in a file together.
Its MD5 is fcce9b26ebe166127951359b36297bd7.
