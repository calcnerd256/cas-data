		<p>
			I want
			to move server.program
			to another machine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Its MD5
			is
			<i>6c4c8123ea1efc8851e333afece5ceba</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			server.program
			is
			a webserver
			written in
			a fake Lisp dialect
			that I haven't implemented yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is
			the server for
			what I had been calling "<i>concierge</i>",
			which is
			my proxy
			that
			doesn't know what to proxy
			and
			only knows how to proxy.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote
			a NodeJS version of it
			that supports
			the structure of
			the fake Lisp version.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is
			the thing that talks to scab
			right now,
			but I want
			to clean it up
			before
			I bring it over
			to another computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			server.program
			should be called
			concierge.program,
			since
			it doesn't
			live in
			the concierge directory
			anymore.
		</p>
		<p>
			But
			mostly
			it
			will be
			referred to
			by
			its hash.
