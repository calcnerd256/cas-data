Apparently I was planning on talking about TDD this time and last time.  I'll have to put it off again.  Sorry.
I found a typo in the digest for last week.  It says "subscribtion" for one of the topics, probably because I tried to change "subscriber" to "subscription".  I wasn't consistent, anyway, as some parts of it say "subscription" and others say "subscribe" and "subscriber".
