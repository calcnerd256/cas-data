I was planning to write the aggregating configurator I described in an e-mail with an MD5 of ccaa13b3af167a1b01f14e29e52dc7b3.
I started writing it for a use case where a service knows where it wants all of its URIs to graft into the main proxy.
As I went about implementing it, I wrote a simpler configurator that only handles the use case I was dealing with.
Now I don't feel like writing the more-complicated one.
Maybe some other time.
With the way it works now, I can happily churn out new services and immediately use them without having to think too hard about how to integrate things.
So I'm going to do some of that.
Maybe static files are next, and then maybe a smarter CAS after that, perhaps with a distinction between public and private files and a distinction between disk-backed files and generated ones.
We'll see.
