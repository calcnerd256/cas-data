I said I'd send out the digest for last week today.
Here it is: MD5 885080daf9525c66c3e4f19b3160d492
I'm going to stop publishing the information about the e-mail previous to each one, as that is basically part of the digest now.
I might also reduce the non-firehose to only the weekly digest in its current format plus a readable summary.
If I do that, I'll have to stop calling the current digest format a "digest", since the readable summary is really the digest, and instead I'll have to call that other thing the weekly index.
We're coming up on the end of a month, so I need to do something special to digest the (formerly-called) digests; and since it's also the end of a year, there might need to be something for that, too (but probably not, since the entire output of this year happened this month).

This has been a week of trying things that don't work, or "enumerating non-solutions", as I like to call it.
Hopefully every misstep has helped me understand what not to do, so that I can make this newsletter better.
Thank you for hanging in there with me through this.
