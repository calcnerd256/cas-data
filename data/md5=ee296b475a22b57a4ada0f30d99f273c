I made another typo.
In the e-mail whose body has an MD5 of 88fbea41dbfe613607e3f5fecfb63503, I said "and, although ..., but I" where I should have only said "and, although ..., I".
I'm getting pretty sick of sending out these corrections for tiny mistakes, but that's what happens when everything is published forever.
Hopefully keeping the cost of mistakes high will encourage me to be more careful so as not to make them as much.
