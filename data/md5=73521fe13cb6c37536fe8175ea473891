Another week, another index (formerly called the "digest").
I haven't written anything worth sending to you guys this last week.
I sent out an e-mail to the firehose about trying to organize the previous weeks' index files, but nothing worthwhile came of that effort.
Here you go: last week's index has an MD5 of 3ccfad21058bba4fdf56e328e55e490d.

To try to make it up to you, here's a fun little program that you can run in your Web browser: circle clock.
I wrote it a long time ago, so it's in a different style than I would be proud of these days.
I wrote most of it back then, and I've made minor modifications to it since without updating my stylistic choices.
You can view it in your browser, but be warned that it uses JavaScript.
I try not to demand that people use pages that require JS, so that's why I'm making the warning explicit here.
It has an MD5 of 9a84f0aaf913d320c756f3abe7f98f08.
Enjoy.
