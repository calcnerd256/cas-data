I wrote a little Python script to convert from the TSV files that generate the index files into the JSON file that navscrib uses as a database.
But I haven't published navscrib yet.
So now I need to do that before it makes any sense to publish that converter.
Navscrib is a notetaking program I wrote for myself.
It doesn't have a very good name, because naming this is hard.
It's the successor to another one called scribnav.
I like it because I can build nodes for notes easily and hyperlink them to each other, and it gives me backlinks so I can traverse from a note to any note that links to it.
I wrote it in a hurry; and, although I've revised it a few times, but I haven't made it into something I can be proud of.
The latest changes were to split it from one big file into several small ones.

MD5 e0121db646c7bd103f3344cc1c81fcff destructively installs navscrib.
MD5 b09f7d705fc000404a9c15fbcf18c613 creates a safe-ish temporary environment in which to run that, runs the installation, and launches navscrib.
It is invoked like this:
bash ./md5=b09f7d705fc000404a9c15fbcf18c613 8080
Then press enter to exit when you're done, or else it won't clean up the environment.

I'm not asking anyone to run navscrib or even suggesting that it's fit for any purpose; I'm just explaining how to run the version I'm publishing if anyone wants to.

After I send this out, I'll continue working on publishing that little Python script that generates a navscrib database for my TSVs.
