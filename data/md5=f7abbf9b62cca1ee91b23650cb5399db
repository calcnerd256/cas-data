I drafted an e-mail to sigcf with an MD5 of 6ca32be5a1befd1c46e270c290e60638, but it needs refinement.
I was hoping to send it out before tomorrow, but that is seeming less and less likely.
I think I might switch to just sending them the names of topics and links to the rough drafts, and they tell me which topics sound interesting enough for me to try to refine them, rather than my trying to turn everything into something readable on a self-imposed deadline.
