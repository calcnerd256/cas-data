			Welcome to
			the first issue of
			my occasional newsletter.
		</p>
		<p>
			It needs
			a name.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm using the placeholder name
			"Special Interest Group for Conferring"
			under the namespace of
			my initials.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hopefully
			that name
			won't be a problem
			if it sticks.
