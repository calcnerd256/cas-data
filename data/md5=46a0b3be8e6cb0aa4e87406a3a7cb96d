I haven't sent anything out in a little while.
There's nothing interesting in this e-mail, so you can feel free to not read it.
I'm only sending it out for completeness.

It's a new month, so I should wrap up what I have outstanding from January.
I should have prepared this as soon as I knew I wasn't going to be sending more out that month, but I let time get away from me.

The table of days has an MD5 of d9d4d6652af0dba57b9265f538668ad2; I should have sent it out early in the month, since it wasn't going to change.
The table of e-mails has an MD5 of 0080ce24a2d97cea0b9bca122230e789.
The table of files for the month has an MD5 of 459db232911e9001a927e691d3f85161.
I'm not tracking topics anymore, so the topics table has an MD5 of 89fbd28b079f07444028e4ca3267ab26.

The last week that I sent anything out has an index with an MD5 of d9b3a78e71d2c0a3e52e714b81ec6d42.
A script that checks the MD5s of the weekly index files for the weeks in January where I actually published and generates a dummy index for the partial week at the end of the month has an MD5 of 5704fc550814107f551ddc2b4ebf7797.
