			I'm thinking about changing the way I do this.
			I thought nobody wanted to drink from the firehose, but now I'm thinking that there's no reason I can't publish the firehose and send it out to an empty set of people.
			So, since most of the feedback I've gotten about this mailing list has been toward sending out less frequent and more refined messages, I think I'll make that the default.
			Anybody who wants to may opt in to receive more, but everyone who doesn't say anything about it will be migrated to the exoteric version of my newsletter, after I make the split.
			I may solicit subscriptions to firehose on a case-by-case basis if I detect that somebody seems to want to be on it and hasn't made their subscription explicit, or if I think they would want it but that they haven't considered it.
			As for everyone who has told me how to communicate with the masses better, I'll assume you want to be counted among the masses.

			I think I'll even let the inner circle help me craft the messages to send to the outgroup.
			I realize that they'll necessarily be the least qualified to do it, as a willingness to receive the firehose means they are not allergic to the things they'll be helping me remove, but they're also the only ones who can be found in the position where the opportunity to perform that work is.
