			This e-mail list
			has been dead
			for awhile.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm starting a new one
			that's a little more personal
			and will update multiple times per week.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to subscribe
			to the new one,
			let me know.
		</p>
		<p>
			The new one
			will be a place for me to
			bounce software ideas off people,
			because I am unfortunately
			a verbal processor.
