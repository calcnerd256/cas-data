I got a new subscriber on the main mailing list.
I need to publish an e-mail body to send to new subscribers.
I think the blurb I've sent out at the beginning of other messages will suffice.
I also noticed that I wanted to use the empty file for something recently, so I'll publish that, too.
The welcome e-mail has a body with an MD5 of 11eae25e4277844e70aee40d7b34a254.
The empty file has an MD5 of d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.
