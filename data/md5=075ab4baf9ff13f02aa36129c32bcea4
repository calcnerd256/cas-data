			That's the hash of <a href="./md5=4eaa2d17b974764f2dfa6ab63cf58b2b">the rough draft of this document</a>.

		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
			I want to copy a program from one computer to another.
			I want to <a href="./md5=aac1ecd2550bfc4acabecfddb22abf3d">go about copying it by publishing it</a>.
			The program I want to move isn't written very well.
			I don't want to publish a bad version of my program.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then I decide to make the program a little better before I'll publish it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Talking about the program reminds me of the direction I want to take this program in the future.
			Thinking about the future of the program gives me <a href="./md5=4f597aa25b3399440b76ef606de22fdb">some new ideas</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then I spent days and days <a href="./md5=3bc45b51cb5f0aec24b9f379709fe3b0">trying to make it readable</a> before giving up.

					A hashing function relates the set of all text documents to the finite set of byte sequences of a certain length.
					For each input (no matter how long that input is), there is exactly one output, and all the outputs are the same length.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the context of content-addressable storage, we pretend that the hash function produces one unique string for each of its inputs.
					I am basically using the hash function as a compression function, then.
				</p>
				<p>
					For even more detail, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">the Wikipedia article on hashing functions</a>.

					A hash is the result of applying a hashing function to an input.
					It is also called a "message digest" here, as in the acronym <abbr title="Message Digest">MD</abbr>5.
